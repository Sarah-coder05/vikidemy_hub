        <p>The world is changing — and education must evolve with it.</p>

        <p>
          Our Digital & AI Skills Program introduces students to foundational
          digital literacy, then gradually guides them into more specialized
          skill areas based on interest and ability.
        </p>

        <p>We begin with:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Digital confidence and basic computer literacy</li>
          <li>Understanding digital tools and platforms</li>
          <li>Logical thinking and problem-solving</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From there, students can branch into:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Creative digital skills (e.g. design)</li>
          <li>Coding and computational thinking</li>
          <li>Technology-driven problem-solving</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This program is not about rushing children into advanced tech skills.
          Instead, we focus on:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Strong foundations</li>
          <li>Confidence with digital tools</li>
          <li>Age-appropriate progression</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Our goal is to prepare students not just for exams, but for a future
          where digital competence is essential.
